I have worked on projects with a few programming languages and am eager to work with new ones.

I try and follow up-to-date "good" software practises, test-driven development and am a strong advocate for tabs in the tabs vs spaces war

#### üìö Interests

I'm very interested in tech (both software and hardware) and am always looking to tinker with existing products to make them better (no promises on that last part)

üñ• \
I enjoy building small, goofy projects (see wordle-ai and more) and look foward to imbibing fragments of anthromorphic qualities in the things I build.

üéÆ \
I recently fell down the PC rabbit-hole and am currently spending my free time grinding the Valorant and League ladders. \
Video games are one of the reasons I got into computer science and are, in my opinion, one of the best mixes of software development, problem-solving and creativity.
